# getting-started
This "getting-started" repository contains informal, unformatted, and generic "Getting Started" design, programming, and software guides for my (Kenneth J. Sauer's aka kjsauer on GitHub's) personal reference and possibly also useful to others getting started in related pastures.

## Useful Tips
I recommend using a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text) to open these text-only files.
