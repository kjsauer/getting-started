# getting-started
This "getting-started" Git repository contains informal, unformatted, and generic "Getting Started" guides to design, programming, and software for my (Kenneth J. Sauer's aka kjsauer on GitHub's) personal reference (but may also be useful to others getting started in related pastures).

## Useful Tips
I recommend using a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text) to open these text-only files.

## Conventions
$ means an action or command line prompt (not entirely consistent throughout), e.g.:  
Take action:  
$ Go to File > Open Folder  
Command Line Prompt:  
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
