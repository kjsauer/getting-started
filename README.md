# getting-started
This "getting-started" repository contains informal, unformatted, and generic "Getting Started" programming and other software guides for my personal reference but possibly also useful to others getting started in related pastures.

## Useful Tips
I recommend using a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text) to open these text-only files.
