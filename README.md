# getting-started
This "getting-started" repository contains informal and unformatted "Getting Started" guides mostly for my own personal reference but possibly also useful to others who are getting started in related programming pastures.

## Useful Tips
I recommend using Notepad (notepad.exe) on Windows or a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text 3) to open these text-only files.
