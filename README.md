# getting-started
This "getting-started" Git repository contains informal, unformatted, and generic "Getting Started" design, programming, and software guides for my (Kenneth J. Sauer's aka kjsauer on GitHub's) personal reference (however, they may also be useful to others getting started in related pastures).

## Useful Tips
I recommend using a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text) to open these text-only files.

## Acronyms
NB: Nota bene (means "Please note" in Italian) (basically, a useful, beneficial note, e.g., to the software program user) (borrowed from PVsyst; see also Getting-Started\PVsyst)

## Conventions
"$" means an action or command line prompt (not entirely consistent throughout), e.g.:  
Take action:  
$ Go to File > Open Folder  
Command Line Prompt:  
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'  
This is especially used when the command is a one-liner (in order to differentiate it from English text).
