# getting-started
Personal "Getting Started" computer, design, programming, and software guides

## Introduction
This "getting-started" Git repository hosted on GitHub contains generic, informal, and unformatted "Getting Started" computer, design, programming, and software guides for my (Kenneth J. Sauer's aka @kjsauer on GitHub's) personal reference. However, these guides may also be useful to others getting started in related pastures.

## Tips
I recommend using a text editor (e.g., Sublime Text) to open & view these text-only files.

## Conventions
"$" means an action or command line prompt (not entirely consistent throughout), e.g.:  
Take action:  
$ Go to File > Open Folder  
Command Line Prompt:  
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'  
This is especially used when the command is a one-liner (in order to differentiate it from English text).

## Acronyms & Definitions
Terms ubiquitously used in this repo:  
NB: Nota bene (means "Please note" in Italian) (basically, a useful, beneficial note, e.g., to the software program user) (borrowed from PVsyst; see also getting-started\PVsyst)  
Repo: Repository, e.g., Git repo (e.g., hosted on Microsoft's GitHub cloud server)
