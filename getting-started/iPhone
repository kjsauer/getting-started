## Apple iPhone Tips and Tricks
Swipe left on text message to Mute conversation

## Sleep Mode
While you're on sleep mode, if you receive >=3 calls from the same number, the call will go through (this is a good design to allow for both sleep and emergency calls to go through).

## Emergency
Tap lock button (5) times in a row to rapidly make an emergency call (hopefully, a feature that's not of any need to anyone ever!)

## Force Restart
Press volume up
Press volume down
Press and hold power on/off button
Ignore anything that comes up on the screen
Just keep holding until you see the Apple logo

## Camera Photo Format
To avoid (like The Plague) Apple's proprietary iPhone camera settings format, which requires the use of an Apple device to open photos, do this: iPhone > Settings > Camera > Formats > Most Compatible
