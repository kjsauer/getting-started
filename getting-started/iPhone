## Apple iPhone Tips and Tricks
Swipe left on text message to Mute conversation

## Sleep Mode
While you're on sleep mode, if you receive >=3 calls from the same number, the call will go through (this is a good design to allow for both sleep and emergency calls to go through).

## Emergency
Tap lock button (5) times in a row to rapidly make an emergency call (hopefully, a feature that's not of any need to anyone ever!)
