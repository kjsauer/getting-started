Google Search (IMHO the best search engine because of answers questions the best)

DuckDuckGo (preferred for privacy reasons and fewer ads/ability to report ads)
Advanced Search methods appear to work the same in both

## Example Advanced Searches

"icloud notes" site:news.ycombinator.com
##
Search for exact terms: Use quotes and "AND"
$ "insert in quotes"
$ "insert #1" AND "insert #2"
##
Search approximate: Use tilda (~)
$ ~approximate term
