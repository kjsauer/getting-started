# Getting Started with Operating Systems
Kenneth J. Sauer (@kjsauer on GitHub)

## Acronyms
MS: Microsoft
OS: Operating System

## Scope
NB: This is about using OS, not developing OS.

## Common OS
Windows aka OS
MacOS
Linux

## Run Program as Admin
Right click on program > Run as administrator

## Configure Windows 7 Start-up Programs
Start -> Run -> msconfig.exe

## MS Windows OS
Operate as if your computer will break, get stolen, explode or spontaneously combust, fall into a sewer system, get struck by lightning (Zeus' javelin), or get run over by a bus or 18-wheeler at any second.

Store NOTHING (only-)locally except:
--Shortcuts to software applications (aka programs)
--Software application data files that are necessarily saved locally (e.g., PVsyst and SAM archives, unless you figure out how to store these in some folder(s) already synced to the "cloud"; either way, back up archives and keep track in a database, e.g., MS Excel spreadsheet or preferably a comma-separated value .CSV file that can be opened w/out MS suite of software products).

Keep GitHub synced at all times.

Keep track of all software licenses/license keys (e.g., Adobe, MATLAB, NI LabVIEW, PVsyst). (No need for the latter w/ open source software (!), e.g., Anaconda Python, R, etc.).

Backup Internet Explorer bookmarks (the last time I checked, they didn't have a "Sync" function like Firefox).

Microsoft finger salute #3: I can think of one (ha, JK)!
View all open windows

## Microsoft MS Windows Operating System OS
Avoid asterisks in filenames.
Best to start variable names with a letter (not a number) (e.g., a1, not 1a).

Manage devices via MS Windows OS Device Manager (Windows button\Search device manager), e.g.:
$ Right click on USB\Power management\Do not allow computer to turn off power of device

Manage start-up programs via msconfig.

Get familiar w/ Start > Run > one of the following commands:
1. Device Manager (devmgmt.msc)
2. MS Config (msconfig.exe)
3. MS Info (msinfo32.exe)
4. System settings (sysdm.cpl)

Make sure your Task Scheduler isn't running any unnecessary or unwanted tasks.

## Remove Metadata from Photos Before Uploading to Internet and Sharing on MS Windows OS
Before uploading photos to the Internet (obv. selfies), prob. best to remove metadata first:
$ Right click\Properties\Details\Remove Properties and Personal Information
Save version w/ all properties removed; upload that one.

## Launching Software Programs from Command Prompt
Sometimes clicking a link does not launch the software program as desired or expected (e.g., in MS Windows). In such instances, you may try navigating to Windows\Run and type the name of the software, e.g., "GitHub Desktop". Alternatively, you can search for the name of the corresponding EXE (.exe file) on your computer and type that into the MS Windows "Run" program instead (e.g., GitHubDesktop.exe).

## Naming
In general, best to avoid starting file, folder, or variable names w/ a number (e.g., use asdf1, not 1asdf).

## Naming - Developer Note
Avoid spaces in computer username. In general, for folders involving programming, best to avoid spaces and special characters. Sometimes, lowercase and underscores are most compatible (such_as_this). Generally, asdf1 is more preferred vs. 1asdf (i.e., avoid starting file, folder, or variable name w/ a number). A Git repository (repo) name has dashes like-this. Folders w/in that repo have underscores like_this.

## OS Feature Request(s)
1. Windows Search: It would help if Ctrl+f of "holders" would find "holder(s)", i.e., ignore the parentheses.

## MS Windows OS
"X out" of window by single-clicking upper-right corner OR by double clicking upper-left corner (the latter is a lesser-known method)

## Choosing Windows Login Username
Keep it short, so you're less likely to hit filename character limit.
DON'T USE SPACES, so you don't have problems w/ Anaconda Python installation.
Don't use capital letters, so you don't have problems w/ Linux installation (i.e., case-sensitive).
Don't use a single letter, so you don't conflict or confuse w/ assigned drive letter.
Don't use something that will confuse people who open files & view authorship, e.g., "Me".
In conclusion, example username meeting all criteria: "xyz"

## Access Temp Folder on Windows Machine
File Explorer > %TEMP%
