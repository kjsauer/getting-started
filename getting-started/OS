##
Windows aka OS
MacOS
Linux

## Configure Windows 7 Start-up Programs
msconfig.exe

## Windows Work Machine

Operate as if your computer will break, get stolen, or get run over by a bus at any second.
Store NOTHING locally except:

--Shortcuts to software applications (aka programs)

--Software application data files (e.g., PVsyst and SAM archives; keep note of/backup archives of this)

Keep GitHub synced at all times.

Keep track of all software licenses/license keys (e.g., Adobe, MATLAB, NI LabVIEW, PVsyst).
No need for the latter with open source software (!), e.g., Anaconda Python, R, etc.

Avoid asterisks in filenames.
Best to start variable names with a letter (not a number) (e.g., a1, not 1a).

Manage devices via Device Manager (Windows button\Search device manager).
e.g., Right click on USB\Power management\Do not allow computer to turn off power of device.

## Windows - Remove Metadata from Photos Before Uploading to Internet and Sharing
Before uploading any photos to the Internet, remove metadata: Right click\Properties\Details\Remove Properties and Personal Information (save version w/ all properties removed, and upload that one).
