# Getting Started with Advanced Search Engine Searching

## DuckDuckGo vs. Google
DuckDuckGo is theoretically preferred for privacy reasons, fewer ads, and greater ability to report ads. However, IMO Google Search is the best search engine. It answers human-phrased questions the best. Advanced Search methods appear to work the same in both. Google also has a better built-in language translator tool. When in doubt, use Google Search because it works better, and life is short.

## Example Advanced Search
Search exact phrase and site: "<insert keyword search term here w/in quotation marks>" site:news.ycombinator.com

Search exact terms: Use quotes and "AND"
$ "insert in quotes"
$ "insert #1" AND "insert #2"

Search approximate: Use tilda (~)
$ ~approximate term
