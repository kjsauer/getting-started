Dorking: "The science of" advanced searching, i.e., "the use of search engines to find very specific data" (source: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24101889>)

## DuckDuckGo vs. Google
DuckDuckGo is theoretically preferred for privacy reasons, fewer ads, and greater ability to report ads. However, IMO Google Search is the best search engine. It answers human-phrased questions the best. Advanced Search methods appear to work the same in both. Google also has a better built-in language translator tool. When in doubt, use Google Search because it works better, and life is short.

## Example Advanced Search
Search exact phrase and site: "<insert keyword search term here w/in quotation marks>" site:news.ycombinator.com

Search exact terms: Use quotes and "AND"
$ "insert in quotes"
$ "insert #1" AND "insert #2"

Search approximate: Use tilde (~)
$ ~approximate term

## Tips & Tricks
Look up word definition
$ Define + <insert_word_or_phrase>
Look up word translation
$ Translate + <insert_word_or_phrase>
Search specific website:
$ advanced google search site:news.ycombinator.com
Exact phrase in quotes (""), exclude w/ minus ("-"), fill missing w/ asterisk ("*"), and find similar (related) w/ tilde ("~")
$ "stuck in my *" -head -ways -brain -teeth ~head
Two words
$ "word1" AND" "word2"
