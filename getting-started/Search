Google Search (IMHO is the best search engine because it answers questions the best).
DuckDuckGo (preferred for privacy reasons and fewer ads/ability to report ads).
Advanced Search methods appear to work the same in both.
Google also has a better built-in language translator tool.
When in doubt, use Google Search because it works better and life is short.

## Example Advanced Searches

"icloud notes" site:news.ycombinator.com
##
Search for exact terms: Use quotes and "AND"
$ "insert in quotes"
$ "insert #1" AND "insert #2"
##
Search approximate: Use tilda (~)
$ ~approximate term
