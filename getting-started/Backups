# Getting Started with Computer Backups

## Guiding Principles
Assume at all times computer will crash! Make backups of important material on Cloud/external hard drive(s). Do not learn this the hard way!

## Deciding What to Back Up
Think about what data is truly important to you. Think about now (career, etc.) and when you are 80 years old (music, photos, etc.). Imagine your computer is hit by a bus later today at the same time that your apartment catches fire. You lose all of your belongings including all hardware appliances. Whatever data you care about had better be backed up in the cloud somewhere. For both better and worse, we are living in the age of private company-hosted cloud servers. Agree with it or not, best to adapt to and embrace the times or else regret it later.

## Data Situation in the 21st Century
The cloud is the primary source. Everything else is a backup.
