## Acronyms
_Ref: At reference conditions of global plane-of-array irradiance, cell temperature, and solar spectrum
DHI: Diffuse horizontal irradiance [W/m^2]
DNI: Direct normal irradiance [W/m^2]
GHI: Global horizontal irradiance [W/m^2]
Gpoa: Global plane-of-array irradiance [W/m^2]
Gpoa_Ref: Global plane-of-array irradiance at reference conditions [W/m^2]
PmpDC: DC power [W]
PmpDC_Ref: DC power at reference conditions [W]
PV: Photovoltaic
thetaZ: Angle of incidence of DNI beam

## Equations in MATLAB Syntax
GHI = DHI + DNI.*cos(thetaZ);

## Deviation in Efficiency Relative to Efficiency at Reference Conditions
dEtaRel_Ref = [(Pmp/Pmp_Ref)*(Gpoa_Ref/Gpoa)] - 1;

## PVsyst Module Quality Loss Factor MQF
Negative adjustment factor AF as loss convention:
af1 [%]
af2 [%]
...
afN [%]
Negative AF as gain convention:
MQF = -1*(1-((1-af1)*(1-af2)*...*(1-afN)))
MQF = -1*(af1+af2+...+afN)

## Electroluminescence (EL) and Infrared (IR) Imagery
