## Acronyms
_Ref: At reference conditions of global plane-of-array irradiance, cell temperature, and solar spectrum
devEtaRel_Ref: Deviation in PV cell or module efficiency relative to reference test conditions (e.g., STC)
AM1.5G: Standard global (G) solar spectrum associated w/ air mass AM ratio 1.5 (air mass is a geometrical calculation whereas spectrum is W/m^2/lambda, where lambda is wavelength of light in nm)
DHI: Diffuse horizontal irradiance [W/m^2]
DNI: Direct normal irradiance [W/m^2]
GHI: Global horizontal irradiance [W/m^2]
Gpoa: Global plane-of-array irradiance [W/m^2]
Gpoa_Ref: Global plane-of-array irradiance at reference conditions [W/m^2]
Gpoa_Sref: Self-reference irradiance derived from a PV device's Isc [W/m^2]
Isc: Short-circuit current [Amps, or A]
IscLin: Deviation from Isc linearity (when assuming a unity 1:1 relationship b/w Isc & irradiance, which applies to so-called "linear" PV devices)
IscNorm_Ref: Isc normalized to reference conditions of spectrum, irradiance, & temperature (e.g., STC)
Pmp: Maximum power (e.g., power at max. power point MPP on I-V curve)
PmpDC: DC power [W]
PmpDC_Ref: DC power at reference conditions [Watts, or W]
PTC: PVUSA Test Conditions (more field-representative test conditions than STC, esp. for the Northern California region encompassing the PVUSA field testing site in Davis, CA; Gpoa=1,000 W/m^2, Tamb=20 degC, & Wspd=1 m/s)
PV: Photovoltaic
STC: Standard Test Conditions (Gpoa=1,000 W/m^2, Tcell=25 degC, spectrum=AM1.5G)
Tamb: Ambient temperature
thetaZ: Angle of incidence of DNI beam
Wspd: Wind speed

## Equations in MATLAB Syntax
GHI = DHI + DNI.*cos(thetaZ);
Mind your degrees & radians (cosd's get degrees)!

## PVUSA Regression
Pmp = Gpoa*(a+b*Gpoa+c*Tamb+d*Wspd)
Supply Gpoa, Tamb, Wspd, & Pmp.
Solve for (a,b,c,d) via multiple linear (multi-linear) regression w/ no (zero) y-intercept, i.e., force y-intercept equal to 0 (Excel can do it, too, if it can hold all your field data, w/ the Analysis ToolPak add-in under File > Options > Add-Ins; see more about Excel limits in Getting Started\Excel).
(In MATLAB, Octave, & prob. Julia, it's as simple as Y\x.)
Plug in PTC conditions + (a,b,c,d) to get Pmp at PTC.

## Fill Factor
FF = (Imp*Vmp)/(Isc*Voc);

## Efficiency
Eta = (Pmp/(height*width))./Gpoa
e.g., Height & width of PV module or system

## Self-reference Irradiance
Gpoa_Sref = Gpoa_Ref*(Isc/Isc_Ref)

## Deviation in Efficiency Relative to Efficiency at Reference Conditions
devEtaRel_Ref = [(Pmp/Pmp_Ref).*(Gpoa_Ref./Gpoa)] - 1;
e.g., Use self-reference Gpoa for so-called "linear" devices so long as deviations from Isc linearity are, e.g., <0.5% (certainly <1%).

## Rules-of-thumb
Ensure that deviations from Isc linearity IscLin are, e.g., <0.5% (certainly <1%).
IscNorm_Ref = Isc.*(Gpoa_Ref./Gpoa);
IscLin = 100*[(IscNorm_Ref/Isc_Ref) - 1];
If deviations, exceed this, troubleshoot the test system (which incl. not just the measurement apparatus & models used; also, the human operators, technicians, engineers involved in the measurement design & in the taking of the actual measurements themselves).

## Quick-n-dirty Power Normalization
Pmp = PmpRef*[1-gPmp.*(Tcell-Tcell_Ref)].*(Gpoa/Gpoa_Ref)
Only works well for >600 W/m^2 w/ Ref of 1,000 W/m^2

## PVsyst Module Quality Loss Factor MQF
Negative adjustment factor AF as loss convention:
af1 [%]
af2 [%]
...
afN [%]
Negative AF as gain convention:
MQF = -1*(1-((1-af1)*(1-af2)*...*(1-afN)))
MQF = -1*(af1+af2+...+afN)

## Quick-n-dirty Series Resistance Approximation
Rs_PVsyst = (Voc-Vmp)/Imp

## Quick-n-dirty Shunt Resistance Approximation
Rsh_PVsyst = 5*Vmp/(Isc-Imp)
