## GitHub Pages
Question:
I have a free plan.
I have to host site with GitHub pages.
I have purchased a theme, so I need to make the code/repo private.
Can I host on GitHub pages keeping the repo as private?
My Site will be available publicly.
Answer:
No, to use GitHub pages on a private repository, you need the PRO plan.
