## Deviation vs. Difference
"Deviation" is "100*(New/Old-1). Old might be the base case.
"Difference" is a subtraction of two values.

## Exponential vs. Linear Rate of Change
Nameplate Value, ValNP = 100%;
Production Tolerance, Ptol = 3%;
Measurement Tolerance, Mtol = 0%;
Column 1: Year (unitless); list years 0-25 (as an example).
Column 2: Rate (%/year); 0.5 in every row except year 0 (which is blank).
Column 3: dT (unitless); starts in year 1 and is the subtraction of each (in this case) year to the previous.
Column 4: V_limit (%) linear; year zero calculation is = ValNP*(1-(Ptol+Mtol)); years 1-25 = V_limit(year prior)-V_limit(year 0)*Rate*dT;
Column 5: V_limit (%) exponential; year zero same as linear; years 1-25 = V_limit(previous year)*(1-Rate*dT);
