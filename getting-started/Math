## Rule(s)-of-thumb: PEMDAS
P: Parentheses first
E: Exponents (powers and square roots, etc.) next
MD: Multiplication and division (left-to-right) next
AS: Addition and subtraction (left-to-right) next

## Deviation vs. Difference
Deviation = 100*(New/Old-1), where Old might be the base (aka baseline) case.
Meanwhile, "difference" is the result of a subtraction of two values.

## Exponential vs. Linear Rate of Change
Nameplate Value, ValNP = 100%;
Production Tolerance, Ptol = 3%;
Measurement Tolerance, Mtol = 0%;
Column 1: Year (unitless); list years 0-25 (as an example);
Column 2: Rate (%/year); 0.5 in every row except year 0 (which is blank);
Column 3: dT (unitless); starts in year 1 and is the subtraction of each (in this case) year to the previous;
Column 4: V_limit (%) linear; year zero calculation is = ValNP*(1-(Ptol+Mtol)); years 1-25 = V_limit(year_prior) - V_limit(year_0)*Rate*dT;
Column 5: V_limit (%) exponential; year zero same as linear; years 1-25 = V_limit(year_prior)*(1-Rate*dT);
