## Foreign Currency
Always better to pay in the foreign currency with a credit card that charges no foreign transaction fees. --Dunecat

## Taxes - Making Changes
If taxes accepted, need to amend.
If taxes rejected, ~5 day grace period to fix & resubmit.

## Traditional 401k (Employer-Sponsored Plan)
Extract money from income now, when likely in a higher tax bracket, to reduce income tax burden. Invest it in Traditional 401k.
Pay taxes later when you eventually extract it, at a time when you'll likely be in a lower tax bracket (e.g., when retired aka not working/earning).
