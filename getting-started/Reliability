# Getting Started with Reliability
Kenneth J. Sauer (kjsauer on GitHub)

## Loose Definitions
Reliability is the probability of failure, e.g., at a given time, t. The goal is to figure out: How long, how much, and how often? (i.e., How long will it take to fail, how much impact will failures have, & how often will failures occur?)

## Product Recall Formula
A = Number of vehicles in the field
B = Probable rate of failure
C = Average out-of-court settlement
X = A*B*C
If X < cost of recall, don't recall
