# Getting Started with Reliability

## Product Recall Formula
A = Number of vehicles in the field
B = Probable rate of failure
C = Average out-of-court settlement
X = A*B*C
If X < cost of recall, don't recall

Reliability is the probability of failure, e.g., at a given time, t. The goal is to figure out: How long, how much, and how often: How long will it take to fail, how often will failures occur, & how much impact will failures have?
