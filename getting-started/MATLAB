## Pros of MATLAB
--Easy to build a GUI via GUIDE
--Easy to compile an EXE
--Minimizes software development-related concepts and tasks in favor of science and engineering development

## Cons of MATLAB
--Native data ingest and wrangling (incl. Time Series handling) does not compare to Python
--Not nearly as deployable and ubiquitous in the greater software development world
--NOT OPEN-SOURCE

%% Format MATLAB Workspace
clear; close all; clc; format long g; format compact;

%%
a = [1 1]
conv(a,a)
want to do conv(a,a,a)
need to do conv(a,conv(a,a))
function [x] = convm(varargin)
x = varargin{1};
if
first_input_var = varargin{1}
second_input_var = varargin{2}

%% indexing
% Indexing starts with 1, not 0
% [M,N] : Rows, columns
% MATLAB starts with 1
% R starts with 1
% Python starts with 0

%% output to .csv
dlmwrite('fileName.csv',variableName,'delimiter',',','precision',12);

%% exe
% errordlg alone does not terminate code
% use combination of "msgbox" and "error" instead
% wrap code with try catch

%% Thoughts on MATLAB
% Designed for non-software developer engineers who need to compute
% Use for excellent exe compiler and uiimport
% Keep MATLAB importers simple, e.g., single numeric or string input

##
Design MATLAB folders based on function/script co-dependencies and the MATLAB path
Namely, what is necessary to add to the path and how when the developer runs the code

## End of Script
Compliments of JHF
$ disp('Congrats. The program ran completely/successfully. Crack open an ice-cold beer.')

## MATLAB Toolbox vs. Library
A toolbox is typically a collection of MATLAB functions and a library a collection of Simulink blocks. Having said that, many MATLAB toolboxes also offer Simulink libraries as well, e.g. Control System Toolbox, System Identification Toolbox, Instrument Control Toolbox, etc...

## MATLAB Function vs. Script
Scripts are m-files containing MATLAB statements. ... The biggest difference between scripts and functions is that functions have input and output parameters. Script files can only operate on the variables that are hard-coded into their m-file. As you can see, functions much more flexible.

## MATLAB Compiler Lessons Learned
Make sure ALL scripts or functions which are to be called when the EXE is run are added to the compiler.
You will likely need to manually add files (namely, functions) to the compiler.
Upon setting up the compiler, recommend to toggle ON the option to output a log file each time the EXE is run.
