## Scope
Mostly relates to Firefox

## Why Firefox?
Firefox is free and open-source. It's an excellent web browser. On the contrary, e.g., Chrome is licensed as "proprietary freeware" (yikes!).

## Firefox
Advanced settings
Type in URL:
$ about:config
For example, change media.hardwaremediakeys.enabled to false
Restart browser to implement changes

## Hot Keys
Type "m" in Firefox Browser to mute sounds from the tab.

## Hot Keys
Re-open last-closed tab
$ Ctrl+shift+t
Switch tabs backwards (towards last edited)
$ Ctrl+tab
Switch tabs forward
$ Ctrl+shift+tab
Switch tabs up
$ Ctrl+PgUp
Switch tabs down
$ Ctrl+PgDn

## Document Failed to Download
If document fails to download,
Ctrl+Alt+Del
Set priority of browser to High.

## File Naming Conventions
Web browsers have problems with spaces. Spaces will automatically be replaced with plus (+) signs.
Better to replace spaces with underscores (not dashes):
“””
In Unix environments, it is generally recommended to replace spaces in filenames with underscores (_), rather than dots (.) or dashes (-). This is because underscores are more commonly used and supported by Unix utilities and programming languages.
“””
