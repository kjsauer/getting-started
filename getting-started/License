## Copyright
I am not a lawyer, but a Copyright notice makes logical sense to me. I recommend including your GitHub username in the Copyright file, e.g.:
Copyright (c) 2018-Infinity Kenneth J. Sauer (kjsauer). All rights reserved.
Save in top-level repo folder (containing README.md) as "Copyright".

## LICENSE Files
I think I read somewhere that no LICENSE file means NOT open-source aka proprietary. For such code, I would strongly recommend private repositories. Regardless of the contents of the LICENSE file, assume that a private repo means closed-source and public means open-source. The 100 different variants of LICENSE files have made the legal situation around public repos more complex. I am not really sure if a public repo with no LICENSE file is "open-source" or not. For any public repo, assume that, regardless of the contents of the LICENSE file, algorithms around the world are actively mining the code and doing with it whatever they please without your consent (including GitHub itself a la the opt-out GitHub Arctic Archive Program), possibly even profiting on your work that you have chosen to make public, regardless of the existence or content of the LICENSE file).

## BSD 3-clause
Free for anyone to use for any purpose but they need to reference you (the proclaimed author(s) of the source code).
Namely, include their license file in your code and reference the authors.

## MIT
Allows open usage with no constraints.
I do not understand why the MIT brand needs to be associated with all open-source code. See above thoughts on the LICENSE file.
