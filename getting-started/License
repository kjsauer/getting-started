# Getting Started with License Files and Licensing

## Copyright Notice
Disclaimer (ironically): I'm not a lawyer; however, a Copyright notice makes logical sense to me. I recommend including your GitHub username in a COPYRIGHT file, e.g.:
Copyright (c) 2018-Infinity, Kenneth J. Sauer (kjsauer on GitHub). All rights reserved.
Save in top-level repo folder (containing README.md) as "COPYRIGHT". You may include a title string, e.g., "# Copyright Notice for kjsauer's GitHub Repository "insert-repo-name".

## LICENSE Files
I think I read somewhere that no LICENSE file means NOT open-source aka proprietary. For such code, I would strongly recommend private repositories. Regardless of the contents of the LICENSE file, assume that a private repo means closed-source and public means open-source. The ~100 or so different variants of LICENSE files have made the legal situation around public repos more complex. I'm not really sure if a public repo with no LICENSE file is "open-source" or not. For any public repo, simply assume that, regardless of the contents of the LICENSE file, algorithms around the world are actively mining the code and doing what they please w/out your consent (including GitHub itself, a la the "opt-out" GitHub Arctic Archive Program), possibly even profiting on your work that you have chosen to make public, regardless of the existence or content of the LICENSE file).

## BSD 3-clause License
Free for anyone to use for any purpose, but they need to reference you (the proclaimed author(s) of the source code). Namely, include their license file in your code and reference the authors.

## MIT License
Allows open usage with no constraints. I don't know or understand why the MIT brand needs to be associated with all open-source code. See above thoughts on the LICENSE file.

## Explanation by Reddit Users [deleted] & "fajro"
Open Source means the source code is available and you can modify it.
Clarification by fajro: Not all "Open Source" lets you modify it.
Clarification by [deleted]:
Free Software means the source code is available and you can modify it, PROVIDED you release it as free software.
Free Software (aka the GPL), forces all modifications of its software to remain free. While other licenses like the BSD, Apache, MIT can allow for a corporation to [take] your source code and use it themselves.
