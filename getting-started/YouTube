## YouTube Tips and Tricks
Right click YouTube video to loop.

## Hypothesis on YouTube Ads
Hypothesis: The fastest way to avoid YouTube ads is to switch browser tabs & navigate to another YouTube video. Or, mute the video (e.g., w/in the video; otherwise, type "m" in Firefox Browser; see Getting Started\Browser). Google--given its ever-thirsty, insatiable need to serve us ads (in order to "feed the beast")--does not wish to lose the user's attention. It's analogous to gambling at a casino (more gambling = more profit to the casino)--more YouTube viewing = more unwanted ads that Google can serve us (and register as such, e.g., via our "Skip" click, in order to get paid). Making it appear like the ads are losing our attention to their overall platform is perhaps the only way to avoid Google's serving us w/ longer ads (dunno; not sure).
