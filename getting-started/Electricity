## Definitions
I = Electrical current, in Amps [A]
R = Electrical resistance, in ohms [ohms]
V = Electrical voltage, in Volts [V]

To apply voltage, you need two (2) terminals & one (1) ground.

Power loss, in Watts [W] = I^2*R

Power losses due to wire resistance (aka line loss) scales as the square of the current (i.e., current-squared). (Source: http://www.bsharp.org/physics/transmission)

Electrical resistance increases w/ temperature in copper Cu:

"""
The Temperature Coefficient of Copper (near room temperature) is +0.393 percent per degree C. This means if the temperature increases 1°C, the resistance will increase 0.393%. Examples: You have 100 feet of 20 gauge wire and its resistance is 1.015 ohms at 20° C (room temp).
Temperature coefficient of copper:
R = R_ref*[1+alpha*(T-T_ref)], where
R = Conductor resistance at temperature T
R_ref = Conductor resistance at reference temperature Tref, usually 20 degC, but sometimes 0 degC
alpha = Temperature coefficient of resistance for the conductor material
T = Conductor temperature in degC
Tref = Reference temperature that alpha is specified at for the conductor material

So, thermal losses increase power losses in the case of Cu conductors.

## High Quality Transformers - Ohmic Losses
MVT:
- 0.2% Iron Core (No Load)
- 0.9% Copper Winding (Load)

HVT:
- 0.1% Iron Core (No Load)
- 0.4% Copper Winding (Load)

## Power Factor PF
Power Factor (PF) = Real Power (P)/Apparent Power (S)
PF = P/S
