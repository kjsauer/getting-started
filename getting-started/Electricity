# Getting Started with Electricity for Engineers
Kenneth J. Sauer

To apply a voltage, you need two (2) terminals & one (1) ground.

I = Current, in Amps [A]
R = Resistance, in ohms [ohms]
V = Voltage, in Volts [V]

Power loss, in Watts [W] = I^2*R

Resistance increases w/ temperature in copper Cu:

Temperature coefficient of copper:
R = R_ref*[1+alpha*(T-T_ref)]
