# Getting Started with Microsoft Excel
Kenneth J. Sauer (kjsauer on GitHub)

## Function
$ =date(year,month,hour)+time(hour,minute,second)

## Useful Custom Date Format
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

## Cleansing Data
Screen Excel for instances of #DIV/0!
Replace w/ NaN

## Pivot Tables
Structure your data for Pivot Tables; meaning, like a database, with column headers and data in each row. Formulas in a given cell in a given row must only reference data in cells to the left in the same row.

## Hot Keys
Copy a cell (Ctrl+c) and hit Enter in another cell to paste. (Disclaimer: I do not presently use this hot key).
Copy equation to right:
$ Ctrl+r

## Limits of MS Excel
XLS requires Microsoft Office Suite
XLS has limit to number of rows
XLS is only 65,536 rows; XLSX is just over 1M (1,048,576)
Neither Excel format can fit more than a couple years of 5-min data
Need a programming language for that (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, LabVIEW)
