# Getting Started with Microsoft Excel

## Function
$ =date(year,month,hour)+time(hour,minute,second)

## Useful Custom Date Format
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

## Cleansing Data
Screen Excel for instances of #DIV/0!
Replace w/ NaN

## Pivot Tables
Structure your data for Pivot Tables; meaning, like a database, with column headers and data in each row. Formulas in a given cell in a given row must only reference data in cells to the left in the same row.

## Hot Keys
Copy a cell (Ctrl+c) and hit Enter in another cell to paste. (Disclaimer: I do not presently use this hot key).
Copy cell contents (e.g., equation) vertically from top to bottom:
$ Ctrl+d
Copy cell contents (e.g., equation) horizontally from left to right:
$ Ctrl+r

## Limits of MS Excel
XLS (.xls) requires Microsoft Office Suite
Both XLS (.xls) & XLSX (.xlsx) have a serious limit to the number of rows (a serious problem when working w/ more than a small amount of data)
XLS (.xls) is only 65,536 rows; XLSX (.xlsx) is just over 1M rows (1,048,576)
Neither Excel format can fit more than a couple years of 5-min data (!)
Need a programming language for that (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, LabVIEW)
So then it's onto learning how to program (see Getting Started...oh wait...)
