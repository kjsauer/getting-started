##
Box Sync uses token administration
You initially log in with email and password credentials
Assigns a unique ID ("token") linked to your account
Once token is established, your email address no longer matters
Your credentials at that point are the token, not the email address
Your email address credentials are managed via online account
The online account will continue to be linked to Box Sync via the token (not via an email address)
Box Sync will continue to sync to the online repository without having to log out and log back in b/c the online repository is linked to Box Sync via the token
If you log out of Box Sync, you will need to log back in with the new email address credentials
The token does not change until you log out and back in with the new credentials
This administrative design prevents data loss (e.g., if you make changes online while using Box Sync, before logging out of and back into Box Sync)

## TLDR
Box Sync uses token administration
Log in with token
Change email
Does not change token
Until you log out
And log back in
Prevents data loss
