## Gmail
When you open a draft, make a change, and then undo it, Gmail still treats it as a change. (I think it would be better if it did not, because none of the content changed, which is the important thing to know.)

## Email Policy
Yes to the Inbox Zero policy (personal and work).

## Gmail
It's unclear to me why Gmail Drafts don't go into the Trash when they're deleted (!?). Microsoft Outlook handles it this way.

## Attention and Focus
Promote the zero inbox policy. Make a "_todo" folder where you can put anything that involves a necessary "action".
