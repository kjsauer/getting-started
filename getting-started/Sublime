# Getting Started with Sublime Text Editor

## Introduction
Sublime Text (use the latest version, e.g., Sublime Text 3).

## Color Scheme

## Sublime Text Editor vs. Notepad for Opening and Viewing Text Files
If you are in the middle of an unsaved text file (*.txt) open in Notepad.exe and your computer crashes, your work is lost. If you are in the middle of an unsaved text file (*.txt) open in Sublime Text editor and your computer crashes, your work is not lost. Thus, switch from Notepad.exe to Sublime Text editor.

## Hot Keys
Delete line containing cursor
$ shift+delete
Open second screen
$ alt+shift+2
$ alt+shift+3
Etc.

Ctrl+Shift+t to reopen last-closed tab.

## Observations
When Sublime Text 3 is open and you have files open in it, Sublime Text editor tracks their edit status. If you move the open files on your computer, Sublime will register that the file has changed. Sublime, like Git, tracks the change status of files while they are open in Sublime and--importantly--when Sublime is open. If you have files open in Sublime and you close Sublime and then move the files on your computer and then reopen Sublime, the files will simply have disappeared from Sublime; it doesn't register it as a change.

TLDR: Close Sublime Text editor before organizing files (e.g., deleting or renaming).
