## Risk and Risk Matrices
A risk matrix is a matrix that is used during risk assessment to define the level of risk by considering the category of probability or likelihood against the category of consequence severity. This is a simple mechanism to increase visibility of risks and assist management decision making.

My additions:
Risk = Impact x Likelihood x Severity
Category of probability of likelihood = Likelihood
Category of consequence severity: Impact x Severity
