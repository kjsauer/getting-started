## Initiate Repo in Remote Git
Navigate to folder in Remote Git
Launch Git bash
$ git init --bare repo-name.git

##
Do not add to or delete from .git folders
Instead, clone .git folders from the remote server hosting the repo
Clone that repo into your local Git sandbox folder
Make changes locally and sync with remote folders
You can call your local folder of Git repos whatever you want
I store mine in My Documents on a PC

##
Use dashes between words in repo name, not spaces or underscores
