## String Inputs
Import all inputs as strings
Convert the data type only when needed
For example, for decimal truncation or use in numerical calculations (e.g., unit conversions)
Then convert back to string

## Rosetta Stone
Ideally every piece of code would have a data structure Rosetta Stone (RS)
Need cookie-cutter code to implement Rosetta Stone in standard way

## Functions aka APIs
Always write functions to take inputs with SI units
Thereby never a question as to what the units are
