# Getting Started: Slack

## Slack Notes
As a normal user, ask:
1. Where is my data saved (e.g., chats)? How can I back up my important data if needed?
2. What happens when you delete data (e.g., chats)?
If you do not know the answer at least to the first question, probably best to avoid the use of said software program...or at least to tread lightly with it.
