# Getting Started with Chat Apps

NB: Much of this pertains to Slack. MS Teams notes are forthcoming.

## Slack Notes
As a normal user, ask:
1. Where is my data saved (e.g., chats)? How can I back up my important data if needed?
2. What happens when you delete data (e.g., chats)?
If you do not know the answer at least to the first question, probably best to avoid the use of said software program...or at least tread lightly with it.

##  Slack Hotkeys
Ctrl+"/" or Ctrl+"?" to see hot keys

## Slack Test Call
Enter in channel (without "$")
$ /call --test

## Rule of Thumb
If it will matter after today, don't talk about it in a chat room.
