# Getting Started with Statistics

## Standard Deviation
The units of standard deviation are the same as the units of the data itself.

## Useful Equations
Zn*sigma = X_i/sqrt(n)
Zn*sigma*sqrt(n) = X_i
Zn*sigma*sqrt(n) - X_i
sigma/X_i= 1/Zn*sqrt(n)

## Useful Notes
2-sigma does not equal 95% CI
95% CI is 1.96-sigma, not 2-sigma
2-sigma is 95.45% CI
In other words:
2-sigma represents ~95.4% of the normal (Gaussian) distribution
1.96-sigma represents 95% of the normal (Gaussian) distribution
In other words:
2*sigma is more than 1.96*sigma
That's why it's 95.45% and not 95%.
1.96*sigma is p95 (exactly 95%)
Oftentimes, people conflate p95 with 2*sigma

## Useful Distinctions
Bayesian statistics vs. Frequentist statistics
Frequentist involves hypothesis testing
Bayesian involves learnings which are constantly updated.

## Useful Rules of Thumb (Frequentist Statistics)
If p is low, reject the H0

## Useful Conversions
Convert from P95 to 1-sigma uncertainty: Divide by 1.96

## Key Residual Deviation Metrics
mae = mean(abs(residuals));
mbe = mean(residuals);
sse = sum(residuals.^2);
rmsd = sqrt(mean(residuals.^2));
rss = sqrt(sse);
rss = sqrt(sum(residuals.^2));

## Statistical Interpretations - Confidence Intervals CIs
95% CI:
If two (2) statistical (stochastic) values are outside the CI95 range of one another, it's safe to consider them different.
e.g., Timestamp +/- CI95
If two (2) timestamps are outside the CI95 range of one another, it's safe to call them different.

## Statistical Significance
Statistical significance is intimately tied to statistical power.
Statistical significance implies that you have sufficient statistical power.
Considering/reporting statistical significance w/out statistical power leads to egregious scientific mistakes (e.g., 50% of psychology-related papers being scientifically "wrong", e.g., non-reproducible).

## Acronyms/Definitions
CI = Confidence Interval
SE = Standard Error
95% CI of the Mean = Mean +/- 1.96*SE

Confidence that the true population mean is somewhere w/in the confidence interval CI is determined (estimated) by the sample statistics.

## Sampling Protocols
ASNI/ISO/MIL
e.g., ISO 2859-1:1999 Standard, Inspection Level S4
