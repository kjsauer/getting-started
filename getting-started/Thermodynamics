## Earth's Air
Planet Earth's air is an incompressible fluid (generally speaking, for practical calculations & day-to-day life).
"""
For air, when flow velocity is 100 m/s or less, the air is treated as an incompressible fluid, and when the velocity is greater than 100 m/s, the air is treated as compressible fluid.
