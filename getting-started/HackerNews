## Unblock IP Address
When you click on too many Hacker News articles (links), their website algorithm blocks (bans) your IP address. Here's how you unblock (unban) it:

1. Look up IP address (IPv4) while on the affected (banned) network connection:
$ https://whatismyipaddress.com/
2. Navigate to the following URL via web browser:
$ https://news.ycombinator.com/unban?ip=<insert_ip_address_here>
Leave out <>, e.g.,
$ https://news.ycombinator.com/unban?ip=XX.XX.XXX.XXX
Fill in X's with IP address from #1 above.

Responses:
"sorry" if it doesn't work
"unbanned" if it works

If you get "sorry" or a blank page, try inputting the URL in #2 above into your web browser while on a different network connection, e.g., iPhone Hotspot (Wi-Fi).
