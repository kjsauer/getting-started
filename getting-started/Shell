Command Line

Command Prompt
Shell

## Launch Prompt
Windows: Start -> Run -> Type "cmd"

Git (requires installation of Git, e.g., Git for Windows): Start -> All Programs -> Git Bash

Anaconda Python (requires installation of Anaconda Python): Start -> All Programs -> Anaconda Prompt (to launch new Python terminals via Jupyter Notebook or Spyder) or Navigator (to set up specific environments if needed or double-check your installed vs. available versions of various software programs packaged w/ Anaconda; use Anaconda Python 2.7 to run Python 2.7)

## Helpful Hints
Use tab completion

## Useful Tips
Use "cd <path>" to navigate "forward" into a sub-folder of the present working directory, and use "cd.." to navigate "backwards" up a level in the file hierarchy tree.

Use "ls" or "dir" to view contents of present working directory on Microsoft Windows.

## Syntax
Launch terminal shell
Navigate to folders
Change directory
$ cd <path_name>
Show contents of present working directory
$ dir
Similarly list contents
$ ls
Not sure
$ ls bin
Go up one folder in the hierarchy
$ cd..
Present working directory (pwd)
$ .
pwd
$ pwd

## Tab Completion
Enter first few letters (e.g., of pathname) and hit tab
Example:
$ cd FOLDER_NAME\SUB_FOLDER_NAME
Hit tab. This'll bring up the proper FOLDER_NAME.
