Basically use "cd <path>" to go forward in folder hierarchy and "cd.." to go back
Use "ls" or "dir" to view contents of directory on Windows

## Syntax
Launch terminal shell
Navigate to folders
Change directory
$ cd <path_name>
Show contents of present working directory
$ dir
Similarly list contents
$ ls
Not sure
$ ls bin
Go up one folder in the hierarchy
$ cd..
Present working directory
$ .
Present Working Directory

## Tab Completion
Enter first few letters (e.g., of pathname) and hit tab
Example
$ cd FOLDER_NAME\SUB_FOLDER_NAME
Hit tab
This should bring up the proper FOLDER_NAME
