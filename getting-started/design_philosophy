## String Inputs
Import all inputs as strings
Convert the data type only when needed
For example, for decimal truncation or use in numerical calculations (e.g., unit conversions)
Then convert back to string

## Rosetta Stone
Ideally every piece of code would have a data structure Rosetta Stone (RS)
Need cookie-cutter code to implement Rosetta Stone in standard way

## Functions aka APIs
Write functions to take inputs with SI units
Thereby not a question as to what the units are

## Software Design
Fundamentals: EXE + config.csv
EXE prompts user for path of config.csv
EXE needs to be able to find config.csv
config.csv has vertical columns like a database
config.csv can have multiple rows representing different sets of inputs
Design config.csv for SQL

## Good Practice
Unit tests
Rosetta Stones
config.csv files
.exe plus runtime files
